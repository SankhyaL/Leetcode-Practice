Day 1 of Leetcode Practice!!
In this I have solved the Daily Challenge problem Of July Month - 4 July

Problem: Find K-th Character in String
Solution:
class Solution:
    def kthCharacter(self, k: int, operations: List[int]) -> str:
        lengths = [1]
        
        for op in operations:
            lengths.append(lengths[-1] * 2)
            if lengths[-1] >= k:
                break
        shift = 0
        idx = len(lengths) - 1
        
        while idx > 0:
            half = lengths[idx - 1]
            if k > half:
                k -= half
                if operations[idx - 1] == 1:
                    shift += 1
            idx -= 1
            
        return chr((ord('a') - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
